# Currency Integration with Turret Upgrade System

## Overview
Added currency checking functionality to the turret upgrade system to prevent upgrades when players don't have sufficient gold.

## Changes Made

### 1. **TurretUpgradeInfoUICtrl.cs**

#### **New Methods:**
- `CheckSufficientGold(int cost)` - Validates if player has enough gold for upgrade
- `SubscribeToCurrencyManager()` - Subscribes to gold changes for real-time UI updates

#### **Enhanced Display Methods:**
- **`ShowUnlockedState()`**: 
  - Checks gold availability for "Buy" operation
  - Updates button text and color based on affordability
  - Makes button non-interactable if insufficient funds

- **`ShowActiveState()`**: 
  - Checks gold availability for "Upgrade" operation  
  - Updates button text and color based on affordability
  - Makes button non-interactable if insufficient funds

- **`ShowMaxLevelState()`**: 
  - Sets appropriate gray color for max level state

#### **Enhanced Button Click Handler:**
- **`OnUpgradeButtonClicked()`**:
  - Pre-validates gold availability before upgrade
  - Consumes gold via `CurrencyManager.ConsumeGold()`
  - Proceeds with upgrade only after successful gold consumption
  - Refunds gold if upgrade fails for any reason
  - Provides detailed logging for debugging

#### **Real-time Updates:**
- Subscribes to `CurrencyManager.Gold` ReactiveProperty
- Automatically updates button state when gold changes
- No manual refresh needed

### 2. **TurretUpgradeManager.cs**

#### **Clarified Responsibilities:**
- Removed currency logic (moved to UI layer)
- Added documentation clarifying that currency validation should be handled by the caller
- Focused purely on upgrade logic and data management

## Currency Flow

### **Before Upgrade:**
```
1. UI checks: CurrencyManager.GetGold() >= upgradeCost
2. If insufficient: Button becomes non-interactable + red text
3. If sufficient: Button remains interactable + normal text
```

### **During Upgrade:**
```
1. Player clicks upgrade button
2. UI validates gold again (safety check)
3. UI consumes gold: CurrencyManager.ConsumeGold(cost)
4. UI calls: TurretUpgradeManager.UpgradeTurret()
5. If upgrade fails: UI refunds gold automatically
```

### **Real-time Updates:**
```
Gold changes ? CurrencyManager.Gold ReactiveProperty ? UI UpdateDisplay() ? Button state updates
```

## UI States

| Turret State | Gold Status | Button State | Button Text | Text Color |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Unlocked (Lv 0) | Sufficient | Interactable | "Buy" | White |
| Unlocked (Lv 0) | Insufficient | Non-interactable | "Buy (Not enough gold)" | Red |
| Active (Lv >0) | Sufficient | Interactable | "Upgrade" | White |
| Active (Lv >0) | Insufficient | Non-interactable | "Upgrade (Not enough gold)" | Red |
| Max Level | N/A | Non-interactable | "Max Level" | Gray |
| Locked | N/A | Hidden | N/A | N/A |

## Benefits

1. **Prevention of Invalid Transactions**: Players can't attempt upgrades without sufficient funds
2. **Real-time Feedback**: Button state updates immediately when gold changes
3. **Clear Visual Indicators**: Color coding and text changes communicate affordability
4. **Automatic Refunds**: Failed upgrades automatically refund consumed gold
5. **Separation of Concerns**: Currency logic in UI, upgrade logic in manager
6. **Reactive Design**: Uses R3 ReactiveProperty for automatic updates

## Integration Points

- **CurrencyManager**: Provides gold checking and consumption functionality
- **TurretUpgradeManager**: Handles upgrade logic without currency concerns
- **UI Layer**: Manages currency validation and user feedback

The system now provides a complete, user-friendly upgrade experience with proper currency validation and clear visual feedback.
