# TurretUpgradeManager Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **TurretUpgradeInfoUICtrl.cs**
- **Removed**: `buttonBuy` field and all related logic
- **Modified**: `buttonUpgrade` now handles both buy and upgrade operations
- **Added**: Dynamic button text that changes based on turret state:
  - "Buy" when turret is level 0 (unlocked but inactive)
  - "Upgrade" when turret is level > 0 (active)
  - "Max Level" when turret is at maximum level
- **Simplified**: Single button click handler `OnUpgradeButtonClicked()` for all operations
- **Removed**: `OnBuyButtonClicked()` method and related listeners

### 2. **TurretUpgradeManager.cs**
- **Removed**: `BuyTurret()` method (duplicate logic)
- **Removed**: `onTurretBought` Subject and related observables
- **Enhanced**: `UpgradeTurret()` method now handles both buy (level 0?1) and upgrade (level N?N+1) operations
- **Added**: `GetCurrentTotalStats()` method for proper stats calculation
- **Added**: `GetBaseTurretConfig()` method for accessing base turret configuration
- **Improved**: Better logging that distinguishes between buy and upgrade operations

## Logic Flow

### Before:
```
Level -1 (Locked) ? UnlockTurret() ? Level 0 (Unlocked)
Level 0 (Unlocked) ? BuyTurret() ? UpgradeTurret() ? Level 1 (Active)
Level N (Active) ? UpgradeTurret() ? Level N+1
```

### After:
```
Level -1 (Locked) ? UnlockTurret() ? Level 0 (Unlocked)
Level 0 (Unlocked) ? UpgradeTurret() ? Level 1 (Active) [Buy operation]
Level N (Active) ? UpgradeTurret() ? Level N+1 [Upgrade operation]
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed duplicate logic between buy and upgrade
2. **Single Responsibility**: One method (`UpgradeTurret`) handles all level progression
3. **Cleaner UI**: Single button that adapts its behavior and text based on context
4. **Consistent API**: No need to choose between buy/upgrade methods
5. **Reduced Complexity**: Fewer event subjects and observers to manage

## UI Behavior

- **Locked State (-1)**: Button hidden, stats show "Locked"
- **Unlocked State (0)**: Button shows "Buy", stats show base values
- **Active State (>0)**: Button shows "Upgrade", stats show total (base + bonuses)
- **Max Level**: Button shows "Max Level" and is disabled

The single `UpgradeTurret()` method intelligently handles the appropriate operation based on the current turret level, making the system more intuitive and maintainable.
